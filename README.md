# sd-delete-user
Small plugin to remove users from your WordPress website

## Usage
Change the file to match your needs. You can do this by updating the $mail variable to the address used by the user you want to delete. Now you can upload the file to the mu-plugin folder on your website. If that folder doesn't exist yet just create it. Now, just go to the website and you should be done. This plugin cleans itself after a successful run, so it should be gone when you're done.
